Welcome to the SQL with PostgreSQL course repository! This repository contains the fundamentals of SQL using one of the most powerful and popular relational database management systems, PostgreSQL. Throughout the course, I learned how to interact with databases, perform complex queries, and manage data efficiently.

| Section                          | Description                                                                                                         | Level       |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Section 1: Setting up Test Environment | This section covers setting up the environment for working with PostgreSQL. It includes Docker as the recommended setup, connecting through tools like TablePlus and PgAdmin, and exploring serverless options like Neon.tech. | Beginner    |
| Section 2: General Overview and First Steps | In this section, you'll learn the basics of databases and how to interact with them. You'll create your first table, insert and manipulate records, and explore basic SQL commands like SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and WHERE. | Beginner    |
| Section 3: Aggregation Functions - Grouping and Sorting | This section dives into aggregate functions such as MAX, MIN, COUNT, and AVG. You'll also learn how to group and sort data using GROUP BY and HAVING, and work with subqueries for more complex queries. | Intermediate |
| Section 4: Intermediate - Relations, Keys, and Constraints | You'll explore database relationships, primary and foreign keys, and constraints in this section. You'll also learn how to manage indexes and create constraints like UNIQUE and CHECK for data integrity. | Intermediate |
| Section 5: Intermediate - Data Separation into Other Tables | This section covers separating data into related tables, working with foreign keys, and ensuring data consistency through updates. You will also handle tasks like creating and linking a language table. | Intermediate |
| Section 6: Joins | Learn how to combine data from multiple tables using JOINs. You'll cover INNER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, and RIGHT OUTER JOIN, along with practical tasks that involve aggregations and joins for complex queries. | Intermediate |
| Section 7: Queries - Dates, Intervals, and Date Functions | This section focuses on working with dates in SQL. You'll learn how to perform queries based on date ranges, calculate date differences, and use interval functions to manage temporal data. | Intermediate |
| Section 8: Primary Key Generation | Here, you'll explore different methods for generating primary keys, including SERIAL, IDENTITY, and UUIDs. You'll also learn about composite keys and managing sequences in PostgreSQL. | Intermediate |
| Section 9: Database Design - Medium | This section introduces database design using entity-relationship diagrams. You'll design tables for a "Medium" style application, including users, posts, comments, and more, and set up necessary indexes. | Intermediate |
| Section 10: Exercises with Medium Database - Intro to Functions | Practice querying the "Medium" database through a series of exercises. You'll also learn how to write more advanced queries and work with functions for reusable database logic. | Intermediate |
| Section 11: Database Design - More Exercises | This section dives deeper into database design principles with additional exercises. You'll work on designing databases for different use cases like warehouses and social media platforms, and solve real-world problems. | Advanced    |
| Section 12: Views, Materialized Views, and Common Table Expressions | Learn about creating and using views, materialized views, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex queries. You'll explore recursive CTEs and apply them to hierarchical data structures. | Advanced    |
| Section 13: Custom Functions | This section introduces custom SQL functions. You'll learn how to create reusable functions for complex logic, handle variables and conditions within functions, and manage dynamic queries. | Advanced    |
| Section 14: Stored Procedures | You'll learn how to create and use stored procedures to encapsulate logic that can be reused across multiple queries. This section covers procedures for handling salary raises and manipulating data. | Advanced    |
| Section 15: Triggers + Functions + Procedures | This final section covers creating triggers that automatically execute functions or procedures in response to specific database events, like data changes. You'll apply this knowledge to user authentication and other real-world scenarios. | Advanced    |
